How can you use semantic segmentation to track objects in robotics?

Semantic segmentation is a fundamental component of self-driving cars' perception systems. By categorizing the environment into distinct classes such as cars, pedestrians, and roads, semantic segmentation provides a detailed understanding that enables accurate object identification and tracking. This breakdown allows self-driving cars to adapt to changing conditions and safely navigate complex situations. Moreover, semantic segmentation plays a key role in route planning, ensuring efficient and collision-free navigation. When combined with other sensors like LiDAR and radar, semantic segmentation enhances the car's overall perception capabilities, contributing to the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation.
